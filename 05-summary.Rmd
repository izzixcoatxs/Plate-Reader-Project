# Experiment 4

## Procedure

This study will use Pseudomonas aeruginosa and another water borne isolate on R2A plates. 3 inoculum levels will be used; 10 plates per inoculum level for both species. The preparation of the plates is carried out over two days. 

**Day 1: **

*	Streak colony from culture plate onto agar slope  
*	Incubate agar slope overnight 


**Day 2: **

*	Add glass beads to the inoculated agar slope
*	Add 10ml saline to the inoculated slope  
*	Invert the slope a few times 
*	Vortex the slope for 1 minute 
*	Dispense 0.1ml of stock solution in 9.9ml 0.9% saline = 105 
*	Dispense 0.1ml of 105 dilution in 9.9ml of 0.9% saline = 103
*	Dispense 2.0ml of 105 dilution in 8.0ml of 0.9% saline = 500cfu 
*	Dispense 1.0ml of 103 dilution in 9.0ml of 0.9% saline = 102 
*	Dispense 1.0ml of 500cfu in 9.0ml WFI = 50cfu 
*	Dispense 1.0ml of 50cfu in 9.0ml of WFI = 5cfu 
*	Dispense 0.1ml of 102 in 9.9ml of WFI = 1cfu

Using the Oasis pump system, filter the 10mL of water through the filter and attach to an R2A media capsule. This will be performed 10 times for each inoculum level.  

The R2A plates will be incubated at 30-35Â°C for 5 days. 

Once the incubation period is complete, the plates will be read by two technicians - without marking with a pen and by both plate readers.
